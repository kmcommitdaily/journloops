# Get your hands dirty: How I used APIs to bring real data into my websites and why every beginner should practice with them.


> You’ve built pixel-perfect pages with HTML and CSS. Then JavaScript, then React, then Next.js. Each step feels like progress, until you run into one of the most intimidating walls in programming: APIs. Do I understand enough to start? Should I dive into one more tutorial? I wrestled with those exact doubts — and the best way I found through them wasn’t another course. It was building.

> In this case study, I’ll share three simple projects where I got my hands dirty with APIs: a Weather Dashboard, a Movie Picker, and a News App. Each project pushed me a little further in understanding not just how to fetch data, but also how to structure it, secure it, and actually make it useful.

### Objectives
1. Understand the role of APIs in frontend and backend development.
2. Strengthen fundamentals by applying real data.
3. Simplify API concepts for beginners through practical examples.

### Tools Used
- APIs: OpenWeather, TMDB (movies), NewsAPI
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Frontend: React & Next.js
### Key Learnings
### Environtment Variable
> API has special keys that allows you to access data and use them in your website. But this is not only what makes the API keys valuable, they could be use to fetch private data or even access your database. We do not want anyone to have access on that key, and that is where .env takes place. Think of it like a safety volt for your website, you put here all sensitive data that you don’t want just anyone to see. In addition, .env file is also a good place to put your configurations. Treat this file as your single source of truth.
